\maketitle

On the next pages, you will watch a video about graphing derivative functions and will then answer some questions about the video.

\begin{itemize}
\item The goal of this video is to learn how to graph the derivative of a function
\item If you think about a graph as showing you position as a function of time, then the derivative will be velocity as a function of time
\item You can split the graph into places where it is increasing, decreasing, concave up, and concave down to identify where the velocity is positive, negative, increasing, and decreasing
\item When velocity is positive (or negative, increasing, or decreasing), the derivative will have positive y-values (or negative, increasing, or decreasing)
\end{itemize}
